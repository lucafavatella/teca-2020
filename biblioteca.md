## [Universal Library (Million Book Project)](https://archive.org/details/universallibrary) (2007-2008)

Dal [sito del progetto](http://ulib.isri.cmu.edu/ULIBCopyrights.htm):

> The Universal Digital Library (UDL) has books that are both in and out of copyright.
> It is explicit policy of the Universal Digital Library (UDL) to adhere to the copyright policies of all countries in the strictest possible interpretation.
> ...
>
> We are using the following conservative guiding principles for displaying content.
> 1. For those books that are either out of copyright or permission to scan has been granted, we display the entire contents of the book free to read.
>    We deem any book published before 1923 as being out of copyright.
> 2. For books under copyright, we only display the title page and other selected pages not exceeding 10% of the pages, under the fair use policy.
>    We currently deem any book published after 1923 as being in copyright, unless:
>    - a. The book is in public domain (e.g. government publications and other approved not-for-profit societies) 
>    - b. Explicit permission has been received from the author or publisher or
>    - c. There is authenticated information to indicate that this book should not be in copyright. 
>
> An author or owner of a book published after 1923 can request that the entire content be displayed on the UDL website.

## [HathiTrust](https://www.hathitrust.org) (2008-)

Dal [sito del progetto](https://www.hathitrust.org/help_copyright):

> ### Why is access to some items restricted?
>
> Many works in our collection are protected by copyright law, so we cannot ordinarily publicly display large portions of those protected works unless we have permission from the copyright holder.
> Where we have the right to show page images of works, we will make every effort to do so.
> We are currently displaying works that are in the public domain (such as US works published before 1925), uncopyrightable works (such as works of the US government), or works where we have permission from the copyright holder.
> If we cannot determine the copyright or permission status of a work, we restrict access to that work until we can establish its status.
>
> Because of differences in international copyright laws, access is also restricted for users outside the United States to works published outside the United States after and including 1880.
> ...
>
> ### What are the different Copyright statuses of items in HathiTrust, and what do they mean?
>
> ...
> Brief descriptions of the most common statuses are given below.
> Detailed descriptions of all statuses, with information about how they are determined and stored, are available on the [HathiTrust Rights Database](https://www.hathitrust.org/rights_database) page.
> ...
>
> * Public Domain - In general, these are texts that are 1) US federal government documents 2) published in the US prior to 1925 or 3) published outside of the US before 1880.
>   Volumes may be determined to be in the public domain for other reasons, however.
>   ...
> * Public Domain only when viewed in the United States - Works published outside the US prior to 1925 are in the public domain; however, due to the variations in copyright law in countries outside the US, it is estimated that 1880 is the earliest date foreign works may still be under copyright.
>   Therefore, users accessing the volume from US IP addresses will have access to the works published outside the US between 1880 and 1924; however, users with non-US IP addresses will not.
> * In-copyright - Texts that do not meet the criteria for Public Domain (e.g,. US 1925 or later, and not a government document) are treated as in-copyright.
> * Available to nobody; blocked for all users - Works with this status may have been deleted or access may be blocked e.g., pending a rights investigation.
>   This is typically a temporary status while an issue is resolved.
> * Available to everyone in the world - In-copyright Works that the University of Michigan has been given permission by the copyright holder to display on a broad basis.
>   The scope of permission granted may restrict some use, such as not allowing the sale of reprints.
>   ...
> * Undetermined copyright status - Instances where copyright status could not be determined by automatic processes from bibliographic data, copyright research is only partially complete, or an ambiguous, unclear, or otherwise time-consuming situation was encountered.
>   Items with this status are treated as though they are in copyright.
