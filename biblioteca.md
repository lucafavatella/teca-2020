> The Universal Digital Library (UDL) has books that are both in and out of copyright.

> We are using the following conservative guiding principles for displaying content.
> 1. For those books that are either out of copyright or permission to scan has been granted, we display the entire contents of the book free to read.
>    We deem any book published before 1923 as being out of copyright.
> 2. For books under copyright, we only display the title page and other selected pages not exceeding 10% of the pages, under the fair use policy.
>    We currently deem any book published after 1923 as being in copyright, unless:
>    - a. The book is in public domain (e.g. government publications and other approved not-for-profit societies) 
>    - b. Explicit permission has been received from the author or publisher or 
>    - c. There is authenticated information to indicate that this book should not be in copyright.

> An author or owner of a book published after 1923 can request that the entire content be displayed on the UDL website.
